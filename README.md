# DSA Patterns 🚀

Welcome to the **DSA Patterns** repository! This repository is a collection of popular Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) patterns, designed to help you recognize and solve problems more effectively. 💡

## Why DSA Patterns? 🤔
Most coding problems revolve around a limited set of patterns. By mastering these patterns, you can:
- Simplify problem-solving
- Tackle variations of problems confidently
- Improve your speed in interviews

### Patterns Covered 📚
Here’s a list of patterns included in this repository:

| **No.** | **Pattern**                              |
