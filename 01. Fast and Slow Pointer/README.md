# Fast and Slow Pointer üêá

## Description
The **Fast and Slow Pointer** pattern, also known as the **Tortoise and Hare** algorithm, is commonly used in problems that involve detecting cycles or finding the middle element in a list. The idea is to have two pointers that traverse the list at different speeds‚Äîone moving slowly (one step at a time) and the other moving fast (two steps at a time).

### Use cases:
- Detecting a cycle in a linked list
- Finding the middle of a linked list
- Finding the start of the cycle in a circular linked list

## Key Concepts
- **Cycle Detection**: If there‚Äôs a cycle in the linked list, the fast pointer will eventually meet the slow pointer.
- **Middle Element**: The slow pointer will reach the middle when the fast pointer reaches the end of the list.
