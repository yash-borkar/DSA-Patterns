# Overlapping Intervals üìè

## Description
The **Overlapping Intervals** pattern is commonly used when dealing with problems that require merging, inserting, or proc02. Overlapping Intervalsessing intervals. This pattern helps in efficiently solving problems related to interval overlaps by sorting and merging intervals based on their start and end times.

### Use cases:
- Merging overlapping intervals
- Inserting a new interval into a list of sorted intervals
- Finding non-overlapping intervals
- Computing intersections between two interval lists

## Key Concepts
- **Sorting Intervals**: Sorting the intervals based on the start time simplifies processing.
- **Merging Intervals**: If two intervals overlap, they can be merged into a single interval.
- **Non-overlapping Intervals**: Identifying intervals that do not overlap helps in problems requiring separation.
